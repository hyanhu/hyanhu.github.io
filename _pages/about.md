**Hello and Welcome!** 👋 I am Haiyan HU (胡海燕), a postdoctoral researcher at Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology [(HKUST)](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/), working with [Prof. Qian Zhang](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~qianzh/). I received my Ph.D. degree from the same institution in 2025. I received my B.Eng degree in Computer Science and Technology from Wuhan University in 2020, working with [Prof. Yanjiao Chen](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/0020875). I am broadly interested in the intersection of technology and health, especially in areas such as Smart Healthcare, Optical Sensing, Computational Hyperspectral Imaging, and Spectroscopy for Food. My current research focuses on developing cost-effective spectroscopy systems for daily food-related applications. [[CV](/files/CV_HaiyanHU[202511].pdf)]
